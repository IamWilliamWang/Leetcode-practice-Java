/**
 * Heap queue algorithm (a.k.a. priority queue).
 *
 * Heaps are arrays for which a[k] <= a[2*k+1] and a[k] <= a[2*k+2] for
 * all k, counting elements from 0.  For the sake of comparison,
 * non-existing elements are considered to be infinite.  The interesting
 * property of a heap is that a[0] is always its smallest element.
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 * heap = []            # creates an empty heap
 * heappush(heap, item) # pushes a new item on the heap
 * item = heappop(heap) # pops the smallest item from the heap
 * item = heap[0]       # smallest item on the heap without popping it
 * heapify(x)           # transforms list into a heap, in-place, in linear time
 * item = heapreplace(heap, item) # pops and returns smallest item, and adds
 * # new item; the heap size is unchanged
 *
 * Our API differs from textbook heap algorithms as follows:
 *
 * - We use 0-based indexing.  This makes the relationship between the
 * index for a node and the indexes for its children slightly less
 * obvious, but is more suitable since Python uses 0-based indexing.
 *
 * - Our heappop() method returns the smallest item, not the largest.
 *
 * These two make it possible to view the heap as a regular Python list
 * without surprises: heap[0] is the smallest item, and heap.sort()
 * maintains the heap invariant!

 * [explanation by FranÃ§ois Pinard]
 *
 * Heaps are arrays for which a[k] <= a[2*k+1] and a[k] <= a[2*k+2] for
 * all k, counting elements from 0.  For the sake of comparison,
 * non-existing elements are considered to be infinite.  The interesting
 * property of a heap is that a[0] is always its smallest element.
 *
 * The strange invariant above is meant to be an efficient memory
 * representation for a tournament.  The numbers below are `k', not a[k]:
 *
 *                                   0
 *
 *                   1                                 2
 *
 *           3               4                5               6
 *
 *       7       8       9       10      11      12      13      14
 *
 *     15 16   17 18   19 20   21 22   23 24   25 26   27 28   29 30
 *
 *
 * In the tree above, each cell `k' is topping `2*k+1' and `2*k+2'.  In
 * a usual binary tournament we see in sports, each cell is the winner
 * over the two cells it tops, and we can trace the winner down the tree
 * to see all opponents s/he had.  However, in many computer applications
 * of such tournaments, we do not need to trace the history of a winner.
 * To be more memory efficient, when a winner is promoted, we try to
 * replace it by something else at a lower level, and the rule becomes
 * that a cell and the two cells it tops contain three different items,
 * but the top cell "wins" over the two topped cells.
 *
 * If this heap invariant is protected at all time, index 0 is clearly
 * the overall winner.  The simplest algorithmic way to remove it and
 * find the "next" winner is to move some loser (let's say cell 30 in the
 * diagram above) into the 0 position, and then percolate this new 0 down
 * the tree, exchanging values, until the invariant is re-established.
 * This is clearly logarithmic on the total number of items in the tree.
 * By iterating over all items, you get an O(n ln n) sort.
 *
 * A nice feature of this sort is that you can efficiently insert new
 * items while the sort is going on, provided that the inserted items are
 * not "better" than the last 0'th element you extracted.  This is
 * especially useful in simulation contexts, where the tree holds all
 * incoming events, and the "win" condition means the smallest scheduled
 * time.  When an event schedule other events for execution, they are
 * scheduled into the future, so they can easily go into the heap.  So, a
 * heap is a good structure for implementing schedulers (this is what I
 * used for my MIDI sequencer :-).
 *
 * Various structures for implementing schedulers have been extensively
 * studied, and heaps are good for this, as they are reasonably speedy,
 * the speed is almost constant, and the worst case is not much different
 * than the average case.  However, there are other representations which
 * are more efficient overall, yet the worst cases might be terrible.
 *
 * Heaps are also very useful in big disk sorts.  You most probably all
 * know that a big sort implies producing "runs" (which are pre-sorted
 * sequences, which size is usually related to the amount of CPU memory),
 * followed by a merging passes for these runs, which merging is often
 * very cleverly organised[1].  It is very important that the initial
 * sort produces the longest runs possible.  Tournaments are a good way
 * to that.  If, using all the memory available to hold a tournament, you
 * replace and percolate items that happen to fit the current run, you'll
 * produce runs which are twice the size of the memory for random input,
 * and much better for input fuzzily ordered.
 *
 * Moreover, if you output the 0'th item on disk and get an input which
 * may not fit in the current tournament (because the value "wins" over
 * the last output value), it cannot fit in the heap, so the size of the
 * heap decreases.  The freed memory could be cleverly reused immediately
 * for progressively building a second heap, which grows at exactly the
 * same rate the first heap is melting.  When the first heap completely
 * vanishes, you switch heaps and start a new run.  Clever and quite
 * effective!
 *
 * In a word, heaps are useful memory structures to know.  I use them in
 * a few applications, and I think it is good to keep a `heap' module
 * around. :-)
 *
 * --------------------
 * [1] The disk balancing algorithms which are current, nowadays, are
 * more annoying than clever, and this is a consequence of the seeking
 * capabilities of the disks.  On devices which cannot seek, like big
 * tape drives, the story was quite different, and one had to be very
 * clever to ensure (far in advance) that each tape movement will be the
 * most effective possible (that is, will best participate at
 * "progressing" the merge).  Some tapes were even able to read
 * backwards, and this was also used to avoid the rewinding time.
 * Believe me, real good tape sorts were quite spectacular to watch!
 * From all times, sorting has always been a Great Art! :-)

     pos up (and so on with that child's children, etc) until hitting a leaf,
     then using _siftdown to move the oddball originally at index pos into place.

     We *could* break out of the loop as soon as we find a pos where newitem <=
     both its children, but turns out that's not a good idea, and despite that
     many books write the algorithm that way.  During a heap pop, the last array
     element is sifted in, and that tends to be large, so that comparing it
     against values starting from the root usually doesn't pay (= usually doesn't
     get us out of the loop early).  See Knuth, Volume 3, where this is
     explained and quantified in an exercise.

     Cutting the # of comparisons is important, since these routines have no
     way to extract "the priority" from an array element, so that intelligence
     is likely to be hiding in custom comparison methods, or in array elements
     storing (priority, record) tuples.  Comparisons are thus potentially
     expensive.

     On random arrays of length 1000, making this change cut the number of
     comparisons made by heapify() a little, and those made by exhaustive
     heappop() a lot, in accord with theory.  Here are typical results from 3
     runs (3 just to demonstrate how small the variance is):

     Compares needed by heapify     Compares needed by 1000 heappops
     --------------------------     --------------------------------
     1837 cut to 1663               14996 cut to 8680
     1855 cut to 1659               14966 cut to 8678
     1847 cut to 1660               15024 cut to 8703

     Building the heap by using heappush() 1000 times instead required
     2198, 2148, and 2219 compares:  heapify() is more efficient, when
     you can use it.

     The total compares needed by list.sort() on the same lists were 8627,
     8627, and 8632 (this should be compared to the sum of heapify() and
     heappop() compares):  list.sort() is (unsurprisingly!) more efficient
     for sorting.

     Theoretical number of comparisons for k smallest of n random inputs:

     Step   Comparisons                  Action
     ----   --------------------------   ---------------------------
      1     1.66 * k                     heapify the first k-inputs
      2     n - k                        compare remaining elements to top of heap
      3     k * (1 + lg2(k)) * ln(n/k)   replace the topmost value on the heap
      4     k * lg2(k) - (k/2)           final sort of the k most extreme values

     Combining and simplifying for a rough estimate gives:

            comparisons = n + k * (log(k, 2) * log(n/k) + log(k, 2) + log(n/k))

     Computing the number of comparisons for step 3:
     -----------------------------------------------
     * For the i-th new value from the iterable, the probability of being in the
       k most extreme values is k/i.  For example, the probability of the 101st
       value seen being in the 100 most extreme values is 100/101.
     * If the value is a new extreme value, the cost of inserting it into the
       heap is 1 + log(k, 2).
     * The probability times the cost gives:
                (k/i) * (1 + log(k, 2))
     * Summing across the remaining n-k elements gives:
                sum((k/i) * (1 + log(k, 2)) for i in range(k+1, n+1))
     * This reduces to:
                (H(n) - H(k)) * k * (1 + log(k, 2))
     * Where H(n) is the n-th harmonic number estimated by:
                gamma = 0.5772156649
                H(n) = log(n, e) + gamma + 1 / (2 * n)
       http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_series_(mathematics)Rate_of_divergence
     * Substituting the H(n) formula:
                comparisons = k * (1 + log(k, 2)) * (log(n/k, e) + (1/n - 1/k) / 2)

     Worst-case for step 3:
     ----------------------
     In the worst case, the input data is reversed sorted so that every new element
     must be inserted in the heap:

                 comparisons = 1.66 * k + log(k, 2) * (n - k)

     Alternative Algorithms
     ----------------------
     Other algorithms were not used because they:
     1) Took much more auxiliary memory,
